Q. Write a SQL statement to generate a list of all the salesmen who either work for one or more customers 
or have yet to join any of them. The customer may have placed one or more orders at or above order amount 
2000, and must have a grade, or he may not have placed any orders to the associated supplier.

SELECT a.cust_name,a.city, b.ord_no,
b.ord_date,b.purch_amt AS "Order Amount" 
FROM customer a 
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders b 
ON a.customer_id=b.customer_id;
