Q. Write a SQL statement to make a Cartesian product between salesman and 
customer i.e. each salesman will appear for all customers and vice versa 
for those salesmen who must belong to a city which is not the same as his 
customer and the customers should have their own grade.

SELECT * 
FROM salesman a 
CROSS JOIN customer b 
WHERE a.city IS NOT NULL 
AND b.grade IS NOT NULL 
AND  a.city<>b.city;
